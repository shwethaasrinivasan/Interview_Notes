# JS code Explanation:
1. Select all stars and iterate over them
stars.forEach(star => {
Copy
stars is a NodeList (a collection of nodes, in this case, the <span> elements representing the stars).
forEach is a method that executes the provided function once for each element in the NodeList.
star represents each element in the NodeList as the code iterates over it.
2. Add a click event listener to each star
    star.addEventListener('click', function() {
Copy
addEventListener is a method that sets up a function to be called whenever the specified event (in this case, a 'click' event) is delivered to the target (each star).
The second argument is the function that executes when the star is clicked.
3. Retrieve the value of the clicked star
        const value = this.getAttribute('data-value');
Copy
this refers to the star that was clicked.
getAttribute('data-value') gets the value of the data-value attribute of the clicked star (a string representing the star's rating value, such as "1", "2", ... "5").
const value stores this retrieved value for later use.
4. Log the value of the clicked star
        console.log(`Star ${value} was clicked!`);
Copy
This logs a message to the console indicating which star was clicked, using template literals to embed the value of the clicked star within the string.
5. Highlight the stars based on the clicked star
        stars.forEach(innerStar => {
Copy
This iterates over the stars NodeList again, this time within the click event listener. Each element is referred to as innerStar to differentiate from the outer loop's star.
6. Check and apply the color based on the rating
            if (innerStar.getAttribute('data-value') <= value) {
                innerStar.style.color = 'gold';
            } else {
                innerStar.style.color = '#ccc';
            }
Copy
For each innerStar, it checks if its data-value is less than or equal to the data-value of the clicked star (value). This determines whether the star is part of the rating (i.e., one of the stars up to and including the clicked star).
If the condition is true, the star's color is set to gold, indicating it is part of the selected rating.
If the condition is false (meaning the star's data-value is greater than the clicked star's value), the star's color is reset to #ccc, indicating it is not part of the selected rating.
Summary
This code allows users to rate by clicking on a star. The rating system visually reflects the user's selection by highlighting all stars up to and including the one clicked. It effectively uses event listeners, conditionals, and DOM manipulation to achieve this interactive functionality.
