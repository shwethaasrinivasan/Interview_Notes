// Here are the examples you provided:

// 1. **Example 1**:
//    - Input: `s = "ABAB"`, `k = 2`
//    - Output: 4
//    - Explanation: You can replace the two 'A's with two 'B's (or vice versa) to form the substring "BBBB," which has the longest repeating letters.

// 2. **Example 2**:
//    - Input: `s = "AABABBA"`, `k = 1`
//    - Output: 4
//    - Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA." The substring "BBBB" also has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

// Remember the constraints:
// - `1 <= s.length <= 105`
// - `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
// - `0 <= k <= s.length`
