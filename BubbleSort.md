Selection Sort and Bubble Sort are different sorting algorithms. Both are simple and have similar time complexities in the worst and average cases, but they differ significantly in how they approach the task of sorting an array. Let's explore the differences:

Bubble Sort
Mechanism:

Repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted.
Compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted.
Characteristics:

Performance: O(n^2) in the worst and average case scenarios.
Adaptive: Can be optimized to stop early if the list becomes sorted before making the final pass (making it adaptive).
Stable: Preserves the relative order of records with equal keys.
Key Insight: The largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position in the array after each pass.

Selection Sort
Mechanism:

Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
Initially, the sorted sublist is empty, and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list.
The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
Characteristics:

Performance: O(n^2) in all cases (worst, average, and best scenarios).
Not Adaptive: The algorithm runs through all elements even if the array is already sorted.
Not Stable: May change the relative order of records with equal keys, but can be written to be stable.
Key Insight: Selection sort "selects" the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted section and adds it to the end of the sorted section.

Differences Summarized
Operation: Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that are out of order. In contrast, Selection Sort works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion and placing it at the beginning of the unsorted portion.
Performance: Both have O(n^2) time complexity, but the actual runtime can differ because Bubble Sort usually involves more swapping operations.
Memory Usage: Both are in-place algorithms, meaning they require a constant amount (O(1)) of additional memory space.
Adaptivity: Bubble Sort has the advantage of being adaptive; if the array is nearly sorted, it can finish early. Selection Sort makes the same number of comparisons regardless of the initial array order.
Stability: Bubble Sort is stable by default (it does not change the relative order of equal elements), whereas Selection Sort is not stable but can be implemented to be so.
